  <font color="blue"><h1><u>Hi my name is Brianna!</u></h1></font>
  <font color="lime"><h2><i>This is the story of my life</i></h2></font>
<font color="white"><p>I was born on July 20th, 2001. I am currently 15 but i will be 16 on Thursday! I grew up (and currently live) in a small town known as Caledonia, NY. But here's the catch, I don't go to Caledonia School and I technically don't live in Caledonia either. I live in the "hamlet" of Fowlerville. But besides all of that I actually go to York Cental School. I know, confusing, right? Well that's my life, everyday.</p>
  <p>Then again, my bus ride to and from school is 45 minutes. Speaking of school, I will be a Junior this year at York</p>
  <p>I have a total of 48 kids in my grade. TOTAL. That's it. But the total kids in my entire High School is about 200 students. If you drive 30 seconds in any direction from my school there will be hundreds and thousands of acres of farm fields. Lots of trees and fields. But that's noraml for me, I see it everyday 24/7. I even live next to a huge field and my house is surrounded by trees.</p>
  <p>I love it though, cities are way too busy for me. I'm a total country girl. But I still love photography and traveling just like anybody else.</p></font>
